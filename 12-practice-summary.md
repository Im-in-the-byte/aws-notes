# 12. Practice Summary

## 1.AWS Fundamentals
- **Global Infrastructure**: Regions, Availability Zone, Edge Locations.
- **Core Services**: EC2 (compute), S3 (storage), RDS (database), VPC(networking).
- **Scalability & Elasticity**: Auto Scaling, Load Balancing, CloudFront.

## 2. Identity & Security
- **IAM**: Users, groups, rules, policies.
- **MFA & Least Privilege**: Secure access practices.
- **Encryption**: Data at rest (KMS, SSE), data in trasit (TLS, SSL).
- **Shared Responsibility Model**: AWS secures infrastructure, you secure your apps/data.

## 3. Storage & Database
- **S3**: Object sotrage, visioniong, lifecycle policies.
- **EBS & EFS**: Block and file storage.
- **RDS & DynamoDB**: Managed relational and NoSQL databases.
- **Backups & Replication**: Ensuring durability and disaster recovery.

## 4. Networking
- **VPC**: Subnets (public/private), Route Tables, IGW, NAT.
- **Security Groups & NACLs**: Traffic control.
- **VPN & Direct Connect**: Hybrid networking.

## 5. Monitoring & Optimization
- **CloudWatck**: Metrics. logs, alarms.
- **CloudTrail**: API auditing.
- **Trusted Adviser**: Cost, security, performance recommandations.
- **Cost Explorer & Budgets**: Financial tracking.

## 6. Best Practices Recap
- **Design for failure**: High availability & fault tolerance.
- **Automate**: Infrastructure as Code (Cloud Formation, CDK).
- **Security First**: IAM, MFA, encrytion, logging.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: GuardDuty, Config, Security Hub.
- **Optimize Cost & performance**: Right-sizing, reversed instances, cashing.
